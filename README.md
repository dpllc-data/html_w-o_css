__Overview:__ This is a simple newsletter that was created for students. The key here is demonstrating the amount of HTML that is needed when a programmer or developer is unable to utilize cascading style sheets. Just a simple newsletter took over 300 lines of code. This newsletter is the product of being able to hack the Gradebook portion of the Educator Learning Management System; a feature that Flexpoint Education Cloud allows instructors to implement if they have the background. This ability to be able to hack into the Gradebook page has also been enabled through the use of CKEditor. This code, in variation, is currently in production.
___
__Top:__ The top of the Newsletter embeds an image of my current work calendar. This space at the top also serves as the top anchor for all the "TOP" links located throughout the Newsletter.

__#2:__ Another screenshot near the top of the Newsletter where a very important Table of Contents is available. The Newsletter Table topics are linked and anchored to their respective sections. Note the ability at the top of the Table to bypass the Newsletter altogether. Very important feature!!

__#3:__ A sample of a couple of the many sections throughout the Newsletter. Note the simple ability for the student to quickly navigate to the top and bottom portions of the Newsletter using links that are tied to anchors. The students can quickly go to Top and Bottom from any section within the Newsletter.
